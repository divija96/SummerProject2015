TOPIC:Simple steps to get started with radare2:
REFERENCES:https://gist.github.com/sushant94/5e37971f424fd2d6f2d1



1.build r2.
2.download the bin1 file and follow the instructions in the link to make it an executable.
3.run it as usual:  ./Your_File_Name.out     OUTPUT: hello world
4.if it says cannot execute, give it execute permissions: chmod +x ./Your_File_Name.out
5.Then $r2 ./Your_File_Name.out
6.run aa.
7.go into visual mode. `V` for Visual mode.
8.hit p to print the disassembly of the current region.
9.ok, so since this is a simple hello world program,head over to main. To see all the functions that radare detected using the analysis, hit v.
10.So scrolldown the list using arrow keys till you reach sym.main and hit g.
11.hit q to return back to the disassembly.
12.read the disassembly of main.
13. Understanding The code...
see how "puts" is being called.
The string ("hello world" in this case), is moved into edi. Since this string is a constant "baked" into the program, it is stored in the   DATA segment and referenced here directly.
So in x86-64 , upto four arguments are passed through registers, these are usually rdi/edi, rsi/esi ...
